# OOP-Team Profile Generator
### ![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=License&message=MIT&color=yellow)
## Description
#### This repository is where I created a team profile generator application for the manager. The managers would be prompted with questions about their information (name, id, email, and office number) and also a question if they want to add team members. Team members that the manager can add will have roles (engineer and intern). Based on which team role of the new member that the manager choose, the prompt asking about the new team member information would be displayed. After gathering all the information about the team, team.html file will be generated with all the cards containing each member summary.
